## Features
1. Local clock
2. Set a timer for {X} minutes in to the future. Quick buttons are available for common times.
3. Set a timer for a future real world time.
4. Create timer sets for HNMs. Set the first window and all subsequent windows will have timers automatically created.
5. HNM--or grouped--timers can be expanded to show the individual windows.
6. A sound plays when the timer hits zero. You can optionally set up a warning sound to play 10 seconds prior too.
7. Report your timer in party or linkshell chat.
8. Timers are saved to a file so they will still be there if you log out or shut down.
9. Timers persist until you cancel them so you can see how overdue you are.

## Grouping
Grouped timers are collapsed by default to save space. You can expand them to delete subsequent timers individually. You can also delete the whole group easily.
